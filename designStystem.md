**Design System**
- Objective: Used to organize components that carries functions that can be imported in files to build a page or another feature in example.
- It remains the repository organized, since you can import the function/component many times in different files instead of creating functions everytime or creating it everytime in files.

  Example:
  For react, there is a framework based on: Atoms, molecules and organism.
  - Atoms are a single function structure
  - Molecules are functions made using atoms components
  - Organism are made from molecules
 
  There is many other frameworks that we may discover while learning coding. :3
