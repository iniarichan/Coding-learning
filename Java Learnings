**CODE STRUCTURE**

ModuleName = {
datatype variableName = value}

**datatype** is the kind of data that you can have for your values. 
- It's not mandatory to set, sometimes is explicit and sometimes isn't. 
- In some cases it will be mandatory, when this happens it's case of "Tipagem mandatória"
- What is "tipagem"?
  > Tipagem is when you show the datatype for your values
  > It can be "Tipagem fixa" or "Tipagem variável"

**variableName** is the name that you give to a variable that will receive a value
- It's used to identify a variable
- Example:
 string name = Camilla

**Value** is the expected value for the variable, it can be predefined or it can be an input that you will receive.
- In the example above, Camilla is the value.

**ModuleName* or *FunctionName** is a function that will use variables to execute a command.
- A analogy is like a mathematic problem: X² + 3x + 2 = ? 
  >X², 3x and 2 are variables, the Module is the equation that can give a result following the inputs from the values for the variable

**DATA HIERARCHY**
The data hierarchy helps to understand what contains what in a code. To run a program, you need to create relations between variables, functions/modules, archives

Hierachy in java are expressed by
Project > Archives > Applications > Classes > Methods/Functions > Variables

Which means that:
- a Project is made by archives
- Archives are made by applications
- Applications are made by classes
- Classes contains methods/fuctions
- Methods/Functions contains variables

What is Archives?

What is applications?

What is classes?

Class = 
{
